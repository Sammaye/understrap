Sammaye's Understrap
===

This is my rip-off of [Understrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap) by [@holger411 and friends](https://github.com/orgs/understrap/people). This is not a fork of Understrap. It is completely made anew from the grand daddy of our themes, [_s](http://underscores.me/).

## Why?

Because:

- Fits better with the original structure of _s
- Uses bult in WordPress template locator far more
- Easily slide dependency updates in
- Has some of the extra code from Understrap removed
- Comes pre-bundled with some fun shit:
  - [blueimp gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery)
  - [autosize](https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize/)
  - And my own custom little helper for automated form handling and flash messages
- Comes pre-bundled with a few widgets
  - Social Menu widget, like in twentynineteen
- Has some CSS changes:
  - 48 column grid for Bootstrap for true pixel perfect responsive designs
- Has page and post template changes, better for Elementor and friends
- And... Cuz

## Why might it not be good for me?

### No Grunt Tasks

I have no grunt tasks setup. I use PhpStorm. PhpStorm can replace grunt and directly use most node.js build modules.

So, I don't need it.

### No Composer

Well, composer for WordPress is still dodgy so I haven't done it here, understrap is not even on packagist, despite having a `composer.json`.

If you really want composer in this theme then you can make a PR.

Getting Started
---------------

Copy it, and replace these:

- `understrap` with your theme slug
- `Under Strap` with your full text theme name
